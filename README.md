# BlackJack
- CS1 Group Project
- Going to make a traditional game of black jack with a cpu dealer and a user as the player. While being able to produce a frame where the user can see both of their cards and one of the dealers cards upright and the other face down. Also having a hit and stay button where the user can either hit and get another card or stay and the dealer will then go.
